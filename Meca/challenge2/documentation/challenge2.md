## 🛠️ Design Process

### 🔍 Step 1: Technical Drawing Analysis  
- Reviewed the different views: Front, Right, Top, and Isometric  
- Took into account all dimensions, cut views, and hidden lines

### 🧱 Step 2: Base Creation  
- Sketched the bottom profile on the top plane  
- Used the *Boss-Extrude* tool with the specified thickness

### 🌀 Step 3: Holes and Fillets  
- Created the through holes with proper positioning  
- Added inner and outer fillets using the *Fillet* tool  
- Used smart dimensioning for precise placement

### 🔄 Step 4: Central Body Modeling  
- Built the upper structure using *Revolve Boss/Base*  
- Added the central hole and top circular cavity

### 🧩 Step 5: Finishing Touches  
- Verified all overall dimensions and smooth edges  
- Applied the material **Aluminum Alloy 1060**  
- Used *Mass Properties* to calculate the final mass

## 💬 Personal Feedback

- This challenge was an excellent opportunity to strengthen our skills in:
  - *Revolve* operations  
  - Smart dimensioning  
  - Reading and interpreting mechanical drawings  
- We enjoyed the attention to detail and symmetry this part required.  
- It was approachable with basic SolidWorks skills but required sharp observation and discipline.
