## 🎯 Test Objective
This assessment focuses on modeling and assembling intermediate-level mechanical components. The main goals are:
- Create accurate 3D models based on provided technical drawings.
- Compute the **mass** of each part, ensuring a tolerance within ±1%.
- Complete the **assembly of a mechanical sub-system**.
- Determine the **center of mass coordinates** for the assembly in two different configurations.
