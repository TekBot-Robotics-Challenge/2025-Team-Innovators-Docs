## 🧩 Part 2 – Mechanical Gripper Assembly

### 🧱 Steps Completed:
1. Inserted missing components.
2. Continued the assembly process.
3. Verified the movement of the cylinder and gripper arms.

### ⚙️ Specific Constraints Applied:
- **Cylinder fixed** in minimum and maximum positions to measure the center of gravity.
- **Symmetry between linkages**: enforced using a midplane and symmetry constraint.

### 🔄 Result:
- Functional assembly.

## 📝 Personal Notes
- The SolidWorks installation caused a slight delay.
- The test helped strengthen our mastery of SolidWorks basics (extrusion, assembly, constraints).
- The concept of **mechanical symmetry** required the use of a **central reference plane**.
- Special attention was given to material selection to ensure realistic mass calculations.
